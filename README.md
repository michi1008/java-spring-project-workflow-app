# java-spring-project-workflow-app
I wrote Project Workflow App from scratch to learn about building Java web applications. It manages projects, tasks and emploees.
It creates new projects, tasks and employees. For each project, users can select multiple tasks from task options. 
And for each task, users can select multiple employees to work on the task. 
In the dashboard, users can see the current projects and their timelines. 
And if they click "more details", it goes to "project details". 
In this page, it shows the task list that belongs to the project and the employee names that are assigned to the tasks, in addition to the task timelines.
In the 'employee" page, it shows the name of employees and how many tasks are assigned to each employee in a table and pie chart.
